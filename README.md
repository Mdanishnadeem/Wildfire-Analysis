# Wildfire Analysis Project

This repository contains notebooks and scripts for wildfire analysis. The project aims to provide valuable insights into wildfire data, including data scraping, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## Data 
Data for the wildfire was scrapped from https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81 . Specifically Combined_datset was used. The data used for analysis in this
project is from 1963 to 2023. The city for which the Analysis is done is West Odessa.

## Notebooks

1. **using_reader.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to scraping wildfire data.

2. **aqi_extraction.ipynb**: Scrapes Air Quality Index (AQI) data for a specific city.

3. **data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Handles data preprocessing tasks.

4. **final_analysis.ipynb**: Calculates a custom wildfire score, compares it with AQI data, and returns correlations.

5. **visualization.ipynb**: Contains code for generating various graphs and visualizations.

6. **forecast.ipynb**: Implements forecasting techniques for wildfire analysis.

Feel free to explore the notebooks for detailed information on each step of the wildfire analysis process.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the notebooks. You can typically find the necessary packages in a `requirements.txt` file or within the notebooks themselves.
